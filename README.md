# Demo-Version

**(Glyphs Script)**
Quickly prepare a demo version of the current font 

**Demo is not a Trial!**
A demo font is a limited version of a full font, provided for preview and testing purposes. It includes a reduced character set and is not intended for commercial use. The demo gives a general impression of the typeface without revealing its full capabilities — it’s a sample, not a tool.

**Features:**
• Choose between creating a new .glyphs demo source or directly exporting .ttf demo files into a folder on the Desktop.
• The original font remains untouched and safe.
• Adds a (Demo) suffix to the font name.
• Reduces the character set to basic Latin, Cyrillic, digits, and minimal punctuation.
• .notdef control: inserts a standard replacement glyph if missing, or a custom one with the word DEMO. Both styles automatically adapt to the font’s cap height.
• Demo Trap feature: replaces several sensitive glyphs to introduce friction in extended use.
• Adds a License Custom Parameter noting demo restrictions.
• Clears all OpenType features.
• Simple and minimal interface.

**Requirements:**
• Glyphs 3 or newer
• Vanilla module installed (required)
